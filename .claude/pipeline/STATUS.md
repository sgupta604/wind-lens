## How To Update This File

After each pipeline step, update:

1. **Current Phase** to the completed step
2. **Next Command** to the next step
3. **Pipeline Progress** checkboxes

Example after `/plan particle-masking` completes:
```
**Current Phase:** plan-complete
**Next Command:** `/implement particle-masking`

[x] /diagnose  - Complete
[x] /plan      - Complete
[ ] /implement - Not started
[ ] /test      - Not started
[ ] /finalize  - Not started
```

When feature completes (`/finalize` done):
1. Update Post-MVP Bugs/Features table
2. Set Current Feature to next issue
3. Reset Pipeline Progress checkboxes
4. Set Next Command to next issue workflow
