### Most Recent: BUG-004

BUG-004: Wind Animation Not World-Fixed - **COMPLETED** (2026-01-22)

- [x] /diagnose - Complete (2026-01-22)
- [x] /plan - Complete (2026-01-22)
- [x] /implement - Complete (2026-01-22)
- [x] /test - Complete (2026-01-22) - All 253 tests passing
- [x] /finalize - Complete (2026-01-22)

**Fix Summary:**
Changed world anchoring formula to apply 100% anchoring for all altitude levels (removed parallaxFactor multiplication). Depth perception now achieved via color, trail scale, and speed. All tests passing, no regressions.

## What To Do

**Next Feature: particle-colors (Phase 2a Feature 2)**

### Phase 2 Features (in priority order)

See `.claude/pipeline/ROADMAP_PHASE2.md` for full details.

**Phase 2a: Foundation (do first)**
1. ~~`performance-optimization`~~ - Fix FPS (5 → 45+) **DONE**
2. `particle-colors` - Improve visibility against sky **<-- NEXT**
3. `compass-widget` - Small compass in corner

**Phase 2b: Location & Data**
4. `location-awareness` - GPS + heading for real data
5. `sky-viewport` - Calculate visible sky cone
6. `real-wind-data` - Integrate EDR API

**Phase 2c: Advanced**
7. `map-view` - Toggle AR <-> top-down weather map
8. `altitude-input` - Input specific altitude in feet

### To Start a Feature

```bash
/research <feature-name>
/plan <feature-name>
/implement <feature-name>
/test <feature-name>
/finalize <feature-name>
```

### User Testing Notes (2026-01-22)

**Working:**
- Sky detection calibrates on cloudy day
- Particles masked to sky regions
- World anchoring correct
- Drag gesture on altitude slider

**Issues:**
- FPS: 5 (very low - investigating now)
- Particle colors hard to see
- Trees not well detected

## How To Update This File

After each pipeline step, update:

1. **Current Phase** to the completed step
2. **Next Command** to the next step
3. **Pipeline Progress** checkboxes

Example after `/plan particle-masking` completes:
```
**Current Phase:** plan-complete
**Next Command:** `/implement particle-masking`

[x] /diagnose  - Complete
[x] /plan      - Complete
[ ] /implement - Not started
[ ] /test      - Not started
[ ] /finalize  - Not started
```

When feature completes (`/finalize` done):
1. Update Post-MVP Bugs/Features table
2. Set Current Feature to next issue
3. Reset Pipeline Progress checkboxes
4. Set Next Command to next issue workflow
